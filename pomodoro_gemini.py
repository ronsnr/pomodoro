# Place the canvas in the grid at row 1.
# 'sticky="nsew"' makes the canvas stick to all four sides (north, south, east, west) of its grid cell,
# causing it to expand when the cell expands.
canvas.grid(column=0, row=1, columnspan=4, sticky="nsew")
# 'bind' attaches an event handler to a widget. Here, whenever the canvas is resized ('<Configure>' event),
# the 'on_canvas_resize' function will be called.

# These are standard tkinter Buttons. The 'command' option links a button click to a function.
work_button = tkinter.Button(text="Work", command=start_work)
work_button.grid(column=0, row=3)  # Place in row 3, column 0.

# --- START THE APPLICATION --- #
# 'window.mainloop()' starts the tkinter event loop. This is a blocking call that keeps the
# window open, listens for events (like button clicks and window resizing), and runs the
# appropriate event handlers. The script will stay on this line until the window is closed.
